🛠️ HANDS-ON SECURITY ASSESSMENT

Assessment 1: Security Header Analysis

LAB ENVIRONMENT - Sample Output:  
  
curl -I https://demo-app.com  
  
HTTP/2 200  
content-type: text/html; charset=utf-8  
server: nginx/1.18.0  
x-frame-options: DENY  
x-content-type-options: nosniff  
cache-control: no-cache  
pragma: no-cache  
  
🎯 SECURITY ASSESSMENT:  
✓ X-Frame-Options: Properly configured (Clickjacking protection)  
✓ X-Content-Type-Options: Enabled (MIME sniffing prevention)  
✗ Content-Security-Policy: Missing (XSS protection gap)  
✗ Strict-Transport-Security: Missing (SSL enforcement gap)

Assessment 2: API Security Testing

LAB ENVIRONMENT - Sample Output:  
  
curl -X OPTIONS https://api.demo-app.com/users -v  
  
< Allow: GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, OPTIONS  
< Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *  
< Access-Control-Allow-Methods: GET, POST, PUT, DELETE  
  
🎯 SECURITY FINDINGS:  
✓ HTTP methods properly enumerated  
✗ CORS policy too permissive (Wildcard origin)  
✗ PUT/DELETE methods exposed without proper authorization checks  
✓ OPTIONS method enabled for preflight requests

Assessment 3: Cookie Security Audit

LAB ENVIRONMENT - Sample Output:  
  
Inspected Browser Cookies:  
- session_id: Value=abc123; Path=/; HttpOnly  
- user_token: Value=xyz789; Path=/; Secure; SameSite=Strict  
  
🎯 SECURITY ASSESSMENT:  
✓ session_id: HttpOnly flag set (XSS protection)  
✓ user_token: Secure and SameSite flags set (MITM & CSRF protection)  
✗ Both cookies: Missing expiration settings  
✗ session_id: Missing Secure flag (HTTP transmission risk)

📊 SECURITY VULNERABILITY MATRIX

Vulnerability Risk Level Impact Recommended Fix
Missing CSP Header High XSS Attacks Implement Content-Security-Policy
Permissive CORS Medium Data Exposure Restrict to specific origins
Insecure Cookies Medium Session Hijacking Add Secure, HttpOnly, SameSite
Missing HSTS Medium SSL Stripping Implement Strict-Transport-Security
Exposed PUT/DELETE Low to High Data Manipulation Add proper authorization
